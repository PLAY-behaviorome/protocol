<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> The easiest way to find answers to your question is to “Find” (<code>Cmd+F</code> on a Mac or <code>Ctrl+F</code> on Windows) and type the simplest form of the word you’re looking for. For example, searching for the word <code>dog</code> will bring up the FAQ “What if doorbell rings for the dog walker, delivery, etc.?”</p>

<ul>
<li>The only restriction is that the family must live in the same state as the site. It is up to the PI and research team what the maximum distance they want to travel is. Depending on the location, some sites may have longer commute times than others.</li>

<p><say>For the first 90 minutes of this study, we are interested in how mothers and children interact. It should only be you and your child during the first half of our visit.

<p><say>We really want just mom and child in the house during the first half of the visit.

<h5>Parent unsure about sharing videos<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#parent-unsure-about-sharing-videos"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h5>
<p><say>Video data like this is incredibly valuable for us and other developmental researchers around the country.<br>
To participate in this study, we would ask to be able to share the video with other developmental researchers, like the professor who runs our lab. The goal is to make what we learn from you and your baby available to other scientists. We won’t share anything publicly unless you agree to it. On our permission forms, there are two levels of permission and you can indicate whatever you are comfortable with. If you want, we can send you an email with a copy of the form for you to look over. Can I give you a call back in 2-3 days to see if you would be interested in participating?</say></p>

<ul>
<li>It’s okay to run a few practice sessions as a new experimenter. Treat everything from scheduling through data collection and clean up exactly as a normal session. Upload all videos to Databrary and mark the session as pilot in the post-visit notes. Quality assurance and feedback will still be given.</li>

<li>If the battery runs out past 15 minutes of the natural play, reschedule the visit for another time to ensure you can record everything.</li>
<li>If it occurs within approximately the first 15 minutes of the study, ask the mom if it would be possible to reschedule. Remember to be apologetic and professional.<br>

<ul>
